# Prelim_1_ChemE_7770
First Prelim for Chem E 7770, Thomas Roberts


---------------------------------------------------------------------
- Prelim 1 has three questions, each of my attempts at these questions are stored in the Prelim_1 folder.
- The Prelim 1 folder has three sub folders for each question, Q1, Q2, and Q3 
- Each folder should be self sufficient and not rely on the other folders components to run or understand the solution strategy
______________________________________________________________________
1)  Inside each subfolder is as follows 
  - The code to run the answer attempt if needed for that solution
  - A written section, Stored as a PDF. This is typically for derivation information or Conclusions. many of the conclusions will be repeated in a summary in the README files in each sub folder
  - Supplemental figures, if the code generated figures they were removed and placed as a supplemental figure to show what the code should return (and as the answer to the questions)
