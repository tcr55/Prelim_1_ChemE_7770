# Prelim_1_ChemE_7770
First Prelim for Chem E 7770, Thomas Roberts


---------------------------------------------------------------------
- Prelim 1 has three questions, each of my attempts at these questions are stored in the Prelim_1 folder.
- The Prelim 1 folder has three sub folders for each question, Q1, Q2, and Q3 
- Each folder should be self sufficient and not rely on the other folders components to run or understand the solution strategy
