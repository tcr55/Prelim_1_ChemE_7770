# Question 1
---------------------------------
A) Included Files
  1) Q_1_Prelim_7770
    - A document detailing the derivation for part a and explination for part b
---------------------------------
- Question 1 asks for the derivation of the Kinetic limit of transcription for a gene j (r_x_j)
- The by hand derivation is done in the PDF document Titled Q_1_Prelim_7770 and takes up approximately 5 of the pages

B) Summary of answers
  a) answer a is a derivation, so no summary is needed as it is all mathmatical work.
  b) for question b it is asking when an N gene system would be equivalent to the one gene system in class. To get the value to reduce down to the one gene system the new constant E_j would need to be reduced to zero. This is then dependent on Tau_x_j being sufficiently small such that the numerator becomes so small the whole summation reduces to one. The issue with Tau_x_i having any change is if it is too big it only removes the 1+tau term, but if its too small E_j will not reduce, so the only ways to remove E_j are to reduce Tau_x_j under an elongation limited system which would reduce E_j to zero and under elongation limited both the new equation and old equation are equivalent.
